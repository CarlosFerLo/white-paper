# No Name Project - White Paper

Currently the project is in the initial phase of development, so the white paper is not yet available. However, we are working hard to make it available as soon as possible. Stay tuned!

## About

I`ve been doing research about LLM based Agent architectures (I don't know how to call it yet) and I am going to expose an idea that I have been working on for a while. I am going to write a white paper about it and I will make it available here. The main objective of this white paper is not to take credit but to share knowledge and maybe inspire someone to create something new. I am open to suggestions and I am willing to collaborate with anyone who is interested in this subject. I am not a professional in this area, I am just a student who is passionate about AI and I am always looking for new challenges. I hope you enjoy it!
